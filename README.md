#CIS 325 Group Dish Site Project by Alex Spangler and Gavin Johnson

This website makes use of the MERN fullstack through MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend components
to build a website that stores information pertaining to dishes. In doing so, we make use of the MongoDB Atlas Cluster we have created for this project.

Directions:

To run this application, download and unzip the file located on this repository, then open a command-line-interface window.

After doing so, navigate to the backend directory of this folder, and run the command 'node app.js'. This should return a message saying the program
is currently running on port 3001 of your localhost computer and the computer is currently running the SoupDB of MongoDB.

After this, please open another command-line-interface window, and navigate to this same folder, only this time navigating to the frontend directory.
From here, run the 'link-server' command on your command-line-interface in the frontend directory. This should open an html file that runs the website
on your local computer. Go ahead and make use of the respective forms to read from, write to, and update dish records in the MongoDB Atlas cluster. Enjoy!
